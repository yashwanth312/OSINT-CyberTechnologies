This test is split into many different categories, for example \u201cUltrawide video quality\u201d or \u201clow-light zoom photography\u201d\n2. Each category is assigned an importance rating out of 10, for example, \u201cdaylight photography\u201d, which gets a 10 is far more important for most people than \u201c5x Zoom video in Low-light\u201d, which gets a 2\n3. Within each category, each phone gets a score out of 10 for how good it is in that category. \n4. The number of points a phone gets in each category = Importance of category x Score in that category.  For example, if the Huawei P30 Pro scored 5/10 in a catgory that\u2019s 5/10 important, then The P30 Pro\u2019s score for this category would be 5 x 5 = 25 points\n5.

This test is split into many different categories, for example \u201cUltra-wide video quality\u201d or \u201clow-light zoom photography\u201d\n\n2. Each category is assigned an importance rating out of 10, for example, \u201cdaylight photography\u201d, which gets a 10, is far more important for most people than \u201cZoomed video in Low-light\u201d, which gets a 2\n\n3. Within each category, each phone gets a score out of 10 for how good it is in that category. \n\n4. The number of points a phone gets in each category = Importance of category x Score in that category.  For example, if the Huawei P30 Pro scored 5/10 in a category that\u2019s 5/10 in importance, then The P30 Pro\u2019s score for this category would be 5 x 5 = 25 points.\n\nThe categories (and their importance) are as follows:\n\nStandard wide angle video quality \u2013 7 \nUltra-wide video \u2013 3\nZoom video \u2013 4\nLive focus video \u2013 2\nAudio Zoom - 1\n4K Stabilisation - 5\n1080p Stabilisation \u2013 5\nSlow Motion \u2013 4\nDaytime photos - 10\nUltra-wide photos \u2013 5\nZoom photos \u2013 5\nMacro photos \u2013 3\nPortrait mode \u2013 5\nLow-light video \u2013 5\nLow-light ultra-wide video \u2013 2\nLow-light zoom video - 3\nLow-light video stabilisation- 3\nLow-light photos \u2013 7\nLow-light ultra-wide photos- 3\nLow-light zoom photos - 3\nFlash quality / brightness - 3\nLow-light selfies - 4\nDaytime selfies -6\nFront camera video - 5\nAudio quality - 7\n\nSubscribe for more content (IT'S FREE) : https://goo.gl/pLg6fE\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\n\ud83c\udf08 Instagram: https://goo.gl/OUqBBa\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://goo.gl/EFhwqL\n\ud83d\ude0a Facebook: https://goo.gl/Aluzl1\n\nAmazon Affiliate links:\nAmazon US: https://goo.gl/3yS2aP\nAmazon UK: https://goo.gl/gvrsGZ\n\nMy Filming Gear:\nhttps://goo.gl/5HKrBp\n\nMusic is from Epidemic sound:\nhttp://share.epidemicsound.com/pHDFT\n\nThanks to the Hoxton Hotel for letting me shoot there:\nhttps://thehoxton.com/new-york/williamsburg/hotels",

This Battery Life Drain Test will show us which smartphone has the best battery life!  \n\nFAQ:\n\n1. Yes I know all phones are not on max brightness.  I talk about this in the video, and it's to compensate for the varying brightness of the screens - I have set them all to an EQUAL brightness level, not each phone's MAXIMUM brightness.\n\n2.  No the iPhones are not screen-recording.  That red thing surrounding the timer is Auto-Shazam, which I turned on for all phones.\n\n3.  The iPhone XR is not performing close to what Apple (and some other tests) claim, and my suspicion is, as I mention in the video, that these test were performed with all phones at max brightness, whereas, because the XR's screen is not as bright / viewing angles not as good, in this video I have had to set it's brightness percentage higher to compensate - In my opinion this is the fairest way to do it.  The result we got here agrees with some other XR battery comparisons on YouTube.\n\n4.  Some of you are commenting that in past battery tests, the iPhone XS Max has beaten the Note 9 - this is because in those tests, the Note 9 was set at QHD+ resolution, but in this one, at FHD+.\n\n\ud83d\ude04 Subscribe for more  content (IT'S FREE) \ud83d\ude04 : https://goo.gl/pLg6fE\n\nIt would make my day if you could also follow me on:\n\ud83c\udf08 Instagram: https://goo.gl/OUqBBa\n\ud83d\udc26 Twitter: https://goo.gl/EFhwqL\n\ud83d\ude0a Facebook: https://goo.gl/Aluzl1\n\n\n\nMy Filming Gear:\nhttps://goo.gl/5HKrBp\n\nMusic is from Epidemic sound, and HomageBeats:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/homage253\n\n#LikeaBoss",

The camera should be better, and battery life longer.\n\nEnjoy!  :D",
